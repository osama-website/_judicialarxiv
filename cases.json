Under Article 129 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order 1984, the court may presume the existence of any fact which it thinks likely to have happened. Illustration (g) attached to this Article is quite relevant to the facts and circumstances of the case in hand in which the court may draw adverse inference or presumption that evidence which could be and is not produced would, if produced, be unfavorable to the person who withholds it. \r\n<br />\r\n2. According to Order 6 Rule 1 C.P.C, the term \u201cpleadings\u201d include the plaint and the written statement, whereas Order 6 Rule 2 C.P.C accentuates, that every pleading shall contain a statement in concise form of the material facts on which the party pleading relies for his claim or defence. It is also a well settled exposition of law that no party can lead evidence beyond the pleadings. \r\n<br />\r\n3. The denotation and import of phrase \u201cPardanashin lady\u201d depicts a woman who heeded stringent and unyielding canons and ethics of seclusion and privacy and according to the customs may object to show up in a public office or have no communication except behind the screen with any male person save as near relatives. \r\n<br />\r\n4. In our Holy Quran also, the believing women are commanded to draw their cloaks close round them (when they go abroad) and lower their gaze and guard their chastity and not to reveal their adornments except what normally appears.  \r\n<br />\r\n5. In case of a document executed by a pardanashin lady, the burden of proof is on the party who depends on such a deed to persuade the Court that it has been read over to her and she had not only understood it but also received independent and disinterested advice in the matter. This benchmark is equally applicable to an illiterate and ignorant woman who may not be a pardanashin lady. \r\n<br />\r\n6. The obvious underlying principle is to protect and save a weak and helpless woman from danger and risk of an unfair deal, thenceforth, it is to be ensured by the court in tandem, whether the alleged deal or transaction was effected by her free will or through coercion/duress or emotional blackmailing or whether it was simply aimed to deprive her right or interest in the property or divest her due share in the inheritance by male members of her family because of their ignorance, inexperience of business matters and social conditions are not able to understand the nature of business transactions. \r\n<br />\r\n7. In order to handle the issue of exemption of pardanashin lady from personal appearance in Courts, the Civil Procedure Code endows with specific provision with logical solution and forward-thinking to deal with the issue in an appropriate manner which is perhaps not applied objectively by the Civil Courts despite availability of a well-defined remedy with immemorial solution under Section 132 of C.P.C. \r\n<br />\r\n8. The customs and manners advocated under Section 132 C.P.C, characterizes the customs and manners predominating presently and not the customs and manners which were prevalent in antiquity which have now become obsolete. The personal appearance refers to in-person attendance in the Court and if such plea is taken the Court should not compel a pardanashin lady to appear in court for recording her evidence. \r\n<br />\r\n9. The privilege of exemption in court appearance to a pardanashin lady as provided under Section 132 of C.P.C is to be read with Section 75 and Order 26 Rule 1 C.P.C wherein the Court may appoint commission to record the evidence of pardanashin lady as a matter of right, provided such plea was taken in the pleadings and the court is obligated to determine first whether the exemption claimed is permissible within the purview of Section 132 CPC.\r\n<br />\r\n10. In this advanced era of computer age, the information technology is progressing and growing manifold with rapidity. The evidence after proper identification can also be recorded through video link if the facility is available in the court premises or alternately via video call to ascertain whether the pardanashin lady endorsed her signature or thump impression by free will or she was compelled to do this under duress, coercion, fraud, emotional blackmailing or misguidance or to deprive her right or interest in the property or divesting her share in the inheritance.\r\n", "citation": "PLD 2022 SC 99", "SCPCitation": "2022 SCP 8", "reported": null, "dateOfAnnouncement": "26-11-2021", "dateCreated": "12-01-2022", "fileSizeInBytes": 60}, "crl.p._1016_l_2021.pdf": {"caseNumber": "Crl.P.L.A.1016-L/2021", "caseSubject": "Bail After Arrest", "caseTitle": "Nadeem Samson v.

The wisdom of setting up Service Tribunal under Article 212 of the Constitution is to deal and decide the matters relating to the terms and conditions of service of Civil Servants. Under Section 5 (2) of the Services Tribunal Act 1973, the Tribunal for the purposes of deciding any appeal be deemed to be a Civil Court and have the same powers as are vested in such court and even under Rule 18 of the Services Tribunals (procedure) Rules 1974, the Tribunal may record evidence of a witness. \r\n<br />\r\n2. As a forum of exclusive jurisdiction, the Constitutional mandate as well as the provisions of Services Tribunal Act 1973, articulates and commands to do the complete and substantial justice between the parties with a rational denouement of the case. \r\n<br />\r\n3. The foremost aspiration of conducting departmental inquiry is to find out whether a prima facie case of misconduct is made out against the delinquent officer for proceeding further. The guilt or innocence can only be thrashed out from the outcome of inquiry and at the same time it is also required to be seen by the learned Service Tribunal as to whether due process of law or right to fair trial was followed or ignored which is a fundamental right as envisaged under Article 10-A of the Constitution. \r\n<br />\r\n4. A distinction also needs to be drawn between a regular inquiry or preliminary/fact finding inquiry. A regular inquiry is triggered after issuing show cause notice with statement of allegations and if the reply is not found suitable then inquiry officer is appointed and regular inquiry is commenced, whereas a discrete or fact finding inquiry is conducted at initial stage but internally to find out whether in the facts and circumstances reported, a proper case of misconduct is made out to initiate disciplinary proceedings. \r\n<br />\r\n5. The standard of proof looked-for in a departmental inquiry deviates from the standard of proof required in a criminal trial. In the departmental inquiry, the standard of proof is that of \u201cbalance of probabilities or preponderance of evidence\u201d but not a \u201cproof beyond reasonable doubt\u201d, which strict proof is required in criminal trial. \r\n<br />\r\n6. The authority conducting the departmental inquiry should be impartial and delinquent civil servant should be provided fair opportunity of being heard and if the order based on inquiry report is challenged, then it is the legal duty of the Service Tribunal to give some reasons and there should be some discussion of evidence on record which is necessary to deliberate the merits of the case in order to reach just conclusion before confirming, reducing or setting aside the penalty.", "citation": "2022 SCMR 745", "SCPCitation": "2021 SCP 369", "reported": null, "dateOfAnnouncement": "28-12-2021", "dateCreated": "30-12-2021", "fileSizeInBytes": 25}, "c.p._1948_l_2021.pdf": {"caseNumber": "C.P.L.A.1948-L/2021", "caseSubject": "Service/Appointments", "caseTitle": "Government of the Punjab through Secretary Cooperative Societies Department, Lahore, etc v.

The selection process should be within the specified spectrum and attributes and due to breach of this protocol, the doctrine of legitimate expectation will  come into sight for rescuing and ventilating the sufferings of the candidates who were under the bona fide belief that their applications for appointment will be considered without experience marks being not the precondition and if any additional marks are added or considered beyond the conditions to apply or contrary to the Schedule (of statues) that would be highly discriminatory to those candidates who applied as fresh candidates after completing their required education with the hope of securing jobs. \r\n<br />\r\n3. The doctrine of legitimate expectation connotes that a person may have a reasonable expectation of being treated in a certain way by administrative authorities owing to some uniform practice or an explicit promise made by the concerned authority. In fact, a legitimate expectation ascends in consequence of a promise, assurance, practice or policy made, adopted or announced by or on behalf of government or a public authority. When such a legitimate expectation is obliterated, it affords locus standi to challenge the administrative action and even in the absenteeism of a substantive right, a legitimate expectation may allow an individual to seek judicial review of a wrongdoing and in deciding whether the expectation was legitimate or not, the courts may consider that the decision of public authority has breached a legitimate expectation and if its proved then the court may annul  the decision and direct the concerned authority/person to live up to the legitimate expectation. This doctrine is basically applied as a tool to watch over the actions of administrative authorities and in essence imposes obligations on all public authorities to act fair and square in all matters encompassing legitimate expectation. \r\n", "citation": "2022 SCMR 694", "SCPCitation": "2021 SCP 361", "reported": null, "dateOfAnnouncement": "29-11-2021", "dateCreated": "17-12-2021", "fileSizeInBytes": 36}, "c.r.p._292_2021.pdf": {"caseNumber": "C.R.P.292/2021", "caseSubject": "Service/Seniority", "caseTitle": "Hadayat Ullah v.

The term \u201cquasi-judicial\u201d is employed to expound and spell out the persons or authorities, though not part of judiciary but under the bounds of given powers, exercising the functions and tasks of judicial nature. Further, this term is used to describe functions of governmental officers, boards and agencies which perform functions of a judicial character, although they are not part of the judiciary. A quasi-judicial power is not necessarily judicial but one in the discharge of which there is an element of judgment and discretion. \r\n<br />\r\n2. The renowned Latin maxim Ubi jus ibi remedium, articulates in well-defined terms that where there is a right, there is a remedy. In the command of jurisdictive prudence, the courts generally show the restrain with the directions to the parties to first take recourse of an alternate and or equally efficacious remedy rather than to surpass or circumvent such remedy. \r\n<br />\r\n3. When the words are clear nothing remains to be seen and if the words are ambiguous or uncertain then other aids move in. While applying the rule of plain meaning, the hardship or inconvenience if any cannot become the foundation to modify or alter the meaning. The 'plain meaning rule' verbalizes the interpretation using the ordinary meaning of the language.\r\n<br />\r\n4. It is not to be assumed that there is right of appeal in every matter brought before a Court for its consideration. The right is expressly given by a statute or some authority equivalent to a statute such as a rule taking the force of a statute. \r\n<br />\r\n5. Ex Debito Justitiae means as a matter of right or what a person is entitled to as of right. This maxim applies to the remedies that the court is bound to give when they are claimed as distinct from those that it has discretion to grant. The power of a court to act ex-debito justitiae is an inherent to fix the procedural errors which resulted violation of natural justice, provided the conduct of the party applying has not been such as to disentitle him to the relief. \r\n", "citation": "2022 SCMR 25", "SCPCitation": "2021 SCP 340", "reported": null, "dateOfAnnouncement": "18-11-2021", "dateCreated": "01-12-2021", "fileSizeInBytes": 53}, "c.a._263_2014.pdf": {"caseNumber": "C.A.263/2014", "caseSubject": "Pre-emption Cases/.", "caseTitle": "Muhammad Amjad Khan Afridi & others v.

If the suit for pre-emption is decreed by court of law, the pre-emptor stands in the shoes of the vendee and takes the property subject to all existing equities.

The purpose and sagacity of initiating disciplinary proceedings by the employer is to find out and come to a decision whether the charges of misconduct leveled against the delinquent officer/employee are proved or not and in case his guilt is established, what action should be taken against him under the applicable Service laws, Rules and Regulations, which may include the imposition of minor or major penalties in accordance with the fine sense of judgment of the competent Authority/Management. The criminal prosecution is altogether different where the prosecution has to prove the guilt of an accused beyond any reasonable doubt. Both have distinct features and characteristics with regard to the standard of proof. Even an acquittal by criminal court would not debar an employer from exercising disciplinary powers. \r\n<br />2. If a departmental proceeding is triggered on the charges of misconduct, this should be concluded promptly and efficiently within a reasonable period of time rather than spoiling or obliterating the very purpose of such action or inquiry with delaying tactics or prolong it unnecessarily till the eve of retirement, then drop it to the benefit of delinquent employee which would annihilate the entire purpose of inquiry. \r\n<br />3. No hard and fast rule that in each and every case after issuing show cause notice the regular inquiry should be conducted but if the department wants to dispense with the regularly inquiry there must be some compelling and justiciable reasons assigned in writing. \r\n<br />4.

There is a meticulous differentiation stuck between upgradation and promotion. The promotion involves advancement in rank, grade or a footstep en route for advancement to higher position whereas the facility or benefit of upgradation simply confers some monetary benefits by granting a higher pay scale to ventilate stagnation. In an upgradation, the candidate continues to hold the same post without any change in his duties but he is accorded a higher pay scale. It is also well settled exposition of law that the benefit of upgradation is normally granted to the persons stuck-up in one pay-scale for considerable period of their length of service either having no venue for promotion or progression. In order to minimize the anguish or suffering being stuck-up in particular pay scale for a sizeable period, the mechanism of up-gradation as a policy decision comes in field for redress and rescue.

In fact this maxim is used to reprimand or repudiate an unlawful deed as a reaction to another\u2019s misdemeanor. A wrong order or benefit cannot become a foundation for avowing equality or equal opportunity for enforcement of treatment alike rather such right should be founded on a legitimate and legally implementable right. A wrong order cannot be allowed to carry on which hardly confers any right to claim parity or equality. The respondent could not claim that if something wrong has been done in the case of Zahid Arif, therefore, the same direction should be given in his case also for committing another wrong which would not be setting a wrong to right but would be moving ahead and perpetuating another wrong which is disapproved and highly deprecated. No case of any sort of discrimination is made out. The concept of equal treatment could not be pressed into service by the respondent which presupposes and deduces the existence of right and remedy structured on legal foothold and not on wrong notion or whims.

Action could be termed as terrorism if the use or threat of that action is designed to coerce and intimidate or overawe the Government or the public or a section of the public or community or sect, etc. or if such action is designed to create a sense of fear or insecurity in the society or the use or threat is made for the purpose of advancing a religious, sectarian or ethnic cause, etc. Creating fear or insecurity in the society is not by itself terrorism unless the motive itself is to create fear or insecurity in the society and not when fear or insecurity is just a by product, a fallout or an unintended consequence of a private crime. Mere shock, horror, dread or disgust created or likely to be created in the society does not transform a private crime into \"terrorism\". \"Terrorism\" is a totally different concept which denotes commission of a crime with the design or purpose of destabilizing the government, disturbing the society or hurting a section of the society with a view to achieve objectives which are essentially political, ideological or religious. Violent activity against civilians that has no political, ideological or religious aims is just an act of criminal delinquency, a felony, or simply an act of insanity unrelated to \"terrorism\".", "citation": "PLD 2020 SC 61", "SCPCitation": "2019 SCP 231", "reported": null, "dateOfAnnouncement": "30-10-2019", "dateCreated": "30-10-2019", "fileSizeInBytes": 304}, "crl.p._1001_l_2017.pdf": {"caseNumber": "Crl.P.L.A.1001-L/2017", "caseSubject": "For Enhancement/Sessions", "caseTitle": "Haroon Bin Tariq v.

The reason to fix the base recovery level at 8.7% for the purposes of determining the rate of quality premium is that this 8.7% is also taken as base level for fixing the sugarcane procurement price under the sugarcane price fixation formula. Obviously then the quality premium becomes payable for each 0.1% of excess recovery of sucrose achieved by a sugar mill over and above the base recovery level of 8.7%. The only situation when an increase in the rate of ?quality premium? can conceivably be called in question is when it can be demonstrated that revision in the rate of quality premium does not commiserate with the revision in the minimum procurement price of sugarcane. In the present case, as the revision of rate of quality premium was only 1.38% of the sugarcane price for each decimal point increase, there appears to be no logical reason in denying the growers their due share in facilitating the mills in achieving higher than the base sucrose recovery level which invariably results in higher sugar production. The payment of quality premium on sucrose recovery level which is over and above the base level of 8.7% is not something which can be said to be some kind of benevolence or is bereft of any consideration.

There is indeed a need to protect and preserve our historical and heritage sites but the same need not be at the cost of depriving the citizens of Lahore of an efficient, reliable, dependable and modern mass transit system. Preservation and development are not mutually exclusive and can go side by side complementing each other. The reports submitted by the experts suggest that there is no real danger to the protected or special premises which are situated in the vicinity of the Orange Line Metro Train Project (\u201cOLMTP\u201d). The respondents have not placed on record any authentic technical data/analysis that may reflect negatively on or rebut the accuracy of the reports, opinions and the conclusions drawn by various experts. The Government of Punjab is allowed to resume work on OLMTP subject to certain conditions and directions aimed at protection of cultural sites.\r\n\r\nPer Ejaz Afzal Khan, J (Concurring View): The proposed construction of OLMTP does not cause any considerable visual impairment of the heritage sites. Vibration caused by the operation of the train does not pose any significant threat to the said sites. The partially completed Mass Transit System cannot be obstructed on the basis of apprehensions and assumptions of the respondents which have no concrete foundations. The safeguards provided by law and highlighted in the expert reports have been taken care of in the no objection certificate issued for OLMTP by the Director General of Archaeology. Any further measure which is ancillary and reasonably incidental could still be taken at any time if and when anything endangering the heritage sites appears or emerges.\r\n\r\nPer Maqbool Baqar, J (Minority View): Heritage has to be preserved and protected in all respects, all of its virtue, qualities, facets and characteristics are to be secured from all kinds of harms, including impairment of its visual integrity. No doubt OLMTP, being a mass transit project, offers fast mobility facility to the people of Lahore and is planned to cater to about 245,000 passengers everyday and as claimed, the facility shall be an efficient, affordable and environment friendly transport service, and shall help in reducing traffic congestion and the travelling time between places, but if we recall heritage also has its immense significance, and offers lot of public goods and yields public benefits and also helps in poverty alleviation. The right to life as envisaged by Article 9 of the Constitution includes all those aspects of life which go to make a man's life meaningful, complete and worth living. The Director General Archaeology, Punjab is directed to ensure that the heritage impact assessment in the matter be carried out afresh preferably with the assistance of UNESCO; that fullest endeavour should be made to conclude the same preferably within one month from its commencement and within 15 days thereafter the Provincial Director General Archaeology and the Provincial Government shall decide the request for the NOCs in the light of the report/findings of the fresh heritage impact assessment, with an endeavour to find practicable and viable solutions of the problems and issues that may be pointed out in the said assessment so that the project may be completed as early as possible.", "citation": "2018   SCMR  211", "SCPCitation": "2017 SCP 112", "reported": null, "dateOfAnnouncement": "08-12-2017", "dateCreated": "08-12-2017", "fileSizeInBytes": 374}, "Crl.P._32_2017.pdf": {"caseNumber": "Crl.P.L.A.32/2017", "caseSubject": "For Enhancement", "caseTitle": "State thr.

Amount generated by issuing licences for hunting are presumably used for the uplifting of the people of the area where the licensees hunt, thus, locals have an economic interest in conserving the species rather than indulging in illegal hunting.

Cess has been defined as a tax which raises revenue to be applied for a specific purpose. Nomenclature, however, would not be relevant and whether the imposition of a particular cess can be termed as a 'tax' or 'fee' would depend upon the nature of a levy. Both are compulsory exaction of money by public authorities. Whereas 'tax' is a common burden for raising revenue and upon collection becomes part of public revenue of the State, 'fee' is exacted for a specific purpose and for rendering services or providing privilege to particular individuals or a class or a community or a specific area. So long as the levy is to the advantage of the payers, consequential benefit to the community at large would not render the levy a 'tax'. GIDC is not a 'tax' but a 'fee' and the same could not have been introduced as money bill under Article 73 of the Constitution. Natural gas is subject to levy of Sales Tax and GIDC Act does not appear to suggest that it is another instance of Sales Tax levied by the Parliament on the supply of natural gas. Double taxation can be imposed only by clear and specific language and not by implication. For a 'tax' to fall under the Federal Legislative List it must be covered by Entries Nos. 43 to 53. The non-inclusion of any tax in the divisible pool may have other consequences but would not render the levy unconstitutional. GIDC is a fee and not a tax, in the alternative it is not covered by any Entry relating to imposition or levy of tax under Part-I of the Federal Legislative List. On either counts the 'Cess' could not have been introduced through a money bill under Article 73 of the Constitution.
