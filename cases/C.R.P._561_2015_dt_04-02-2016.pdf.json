JUSTICE QAZI FAEZ ISA", "judgmentText": null, "tagline": "Per Qazi Faez Isa, J [Minority view]: The majority judgment has decided to enlarge the scope of the dispute as it wants to examine the \u201cobjects of wildlife legislation in respect of all vulnerable and threatened game species including the Houbara Bustard\u201d. The stated objective may be otherwise commendable, but such enlargement of jurisdiction (when hearing review petitions), is not contemplated by the Constitution or the Supreme Court Rules, 1980. The laws of Pakistan and of the provinces specifically recognize both Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) and Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS), which categorize Houbara Bustard respectively as \u201cthreatened with extinction\u201d and whose conservation status is \u201cunfavourable\u201d. The judgment under review had however noted that these laws are also backed by both Federal and provincial laws, however, certain provisions of the wildlife laws of the provinces Balochistan, Sindh and Punjab violated/infringed the Pakistan Trade Control of Wild Fauna and Flora Act 2012, CITES and CMS.
