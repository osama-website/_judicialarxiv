Accordingly, the preference given to the petitioners over other similarly placed creditors of the two defunct CFCs defeats any claim of locus poenitentiae posited by the petitioners. The said reason therefore suffices to cancel the NOC issued in favour of the petitioners.", "citation": "2016   SCMR  670", "SCPCitation": "2016 SCP 31", "reported": null, "dateOfAnnouncement": "15-10-2015", "dateCreated": "08-02-2016", "fileSizeInBytes": 30}
