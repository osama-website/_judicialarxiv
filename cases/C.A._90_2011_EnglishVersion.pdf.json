Mehr Ghulam Dastagir Khan, etc", "caseFileName": "C.A._90_2011_EnglishVersion.pdf", "authorJudge": "Mr. Justice Jawwad S. Khawaja,", "judgmentText": null, "tagline": "Article 2(9) of QSO provides that when one fact declares ?to be conclusive proof of another [fact], the Court shall on proof of one fact, regard the other as proved and shall not allow evidence to be given for the purpose of disproving it?. The stipulation in Article 128 is that the birth of a child within the period stipulated in Article 128 is conclusive proof that he is a legitimate child. Once the relevant facts as to commencement and dissolution of marriage and the date of birth of a child within the period envisioned in Article 128 are proved, and the date of birth is within the period specified in Article 128(1), then the Court cannot allow evidence to be given for disproving the legitimacy of a child born within the period aforesaid. For the purpose of harmonious construction of Article 2(9) and 128 of QSO, the Court resorts to Section 2 of the West Pakistan Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1962, which provides that if parties are Muslim and in all questions regarding legitimacy or bastardy the rule of decision shall be Muslim Personal Law. As per Imam Abu Hanifa paternity must be denied immediately after the birth of child while as per Imam Yousaf period for denial to the legitimacy/paternity of the child be made within the post-natal period (maximum of 40 days). First denial was made after the period specified above, therefore, the respondent-plaintiff cannot be allowed to deny the legitimacy/paternity of the two children.
