The right to regularization in service under S. 19(2) of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Civil Servants Act, 1973 applies to employees of the government and not to employees of semi-autonomous bodies. The respondents/project employees of \"PEDO\" are, therefore, not eligible for regularization.\r\n", "citation": "2017   SCMR  1201", "SCPCitation": "2017 SCP 74", "reported": null, "dateOfAnnouncement": "06-06-2016", "dateCreated": "05-05-2017", "fileSizeInBytes": 27}
