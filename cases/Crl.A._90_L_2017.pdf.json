JUSTICE QAZI FAEZ ISA", "judgmentText": null, "tagline": "The case of the prosecution based on the testimony of three unreliable witnesses of doubtful integrity could not be established beyond reasonable doubt and therefore the conviction and sentence are set aside. Further, the delay in the conclusion of a juvenile's trial before a juvenile court is a ground for his release on bail as provided in section 10 (7) of the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, 2000. Therefore, considering the provisions of the Ordinance and being mindful that the Constitution envisages \"the protection of women and children\" (clause (3) of Article 25) it would be appropriate to direct that trial of juveniles be concluded by juvenile courts without delay and appeals against conviction be prioritized and expeditiously decided.", "citation": "PLD 2018 SC 823", "SCPCitation": "2018 SCP 113", "reported": null, "dateOfAnnouncement": "15-09-2018", "dateCreated": "28-09-2018", "fileSizeInBytes": 34}
