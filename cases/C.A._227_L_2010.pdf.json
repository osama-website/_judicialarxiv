The question whether a civil servant can unauthorizedly retain official accommodation beyond a period of six months without paying penal rent requires interpretation of the Rules and constitutes a substantial question of law of public importance because the decision by this Court would affect all those civil servants who are subject to the Rules.", "citation": "PLD 2019 SC 563", "SCPCitation": "2019 SCP 79", "reported": null, "dateOfAnnouncement": "21-03-2019", "dateCreated": "29-04-2019", "fileSizeInBytes": 183}
