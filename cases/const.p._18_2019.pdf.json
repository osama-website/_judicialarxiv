JUSTICE UMAR ATA BANDIAL", "judgmentText": null, "tagline": "The petitioners' objection to the alleged lack of jurisdiction of the Sindh High Court in Constitution Petition No. D-444 of 2019 has already been taken in their pleadings/comments filed in the Court. That objection has also been argued on behalf of the two other disputed Members of the ECP. Therefore, it is premature and inappropriate for us to hear that objection presently because the High Court seized of the matter shall soon be pronouncing its judgment thereon.
