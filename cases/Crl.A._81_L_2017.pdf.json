The State, etc", "caseFileName": "Crl.A._81_L_2017.pdf", "authorJudge": "Mr. Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah", "judgmentText": null, "tagline": "The requirement of calculating the percentage of narcotic drug in a liquid preparation or mixture is mandatory as per section 3 of the Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 1997 (the Act) read with the definitional test under section 2 of the Act. The Reports of the Chemical Examiner fail to mention the percentage of morphine found in the intoxicating substance, leaving it uncertain whether it passes for a narcotic drug. This fatal omission makes the Reports of the Chemical Examiner inconclusive and unreliable to support conviction under the Act. The court being a neutral arbiter has to dispassionately appreciate, appraise, examine and weigh the evidence placed before it, rather than by ignoring the evidence and embarking on a probing journey guided by emotions, sentiments and sense of self-styled justice pegged on the lofty notion of societal reform. The direction of the High Court for obtaining fresh samples of the alleged intoxicating substance and preparing a fresh report of the Chemical Examiner amounts to granting the prosecution a premium on its failure to put up a proper case in the first instance. Such judicial intervention is opposed to the adversary principle and offensive to the fundamental right of fair trial and due process guaranteed under the Constitution.", "citation": "PLD 2019 SC 669", "SCPCitation": "2019 SCP 182", "reported": null, "dateOfAnnouncement": "10-05-2019", "dateCreated": "07-08-2019", "fileSizeInBytes": 592}
