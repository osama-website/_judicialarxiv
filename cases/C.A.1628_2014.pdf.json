JUSTICE FAISAL ARAB", "judgmentText": null, "tagline": "At the time of filing of the nomination papers certain properties were not disclosed in the nomination papers though these properties were admittedly in the name of the appellant and her spouse in the revenue record. The legal objection that section 76A of Representation of the People Act, 1976 (\u201cROPA\u201d) is contrary to the provisions of Article 225 of the Constitution is misconceived. Article 225 of the Constitution clearly provides that no election to a House or Provincial Assembly shall be called in question except by an election petition presented to such tribunal and in such manner as may be determined by Act of Parliament. ROPA is an Act of the Parliament, which has provided the manner in which election is to be challenged before the Election Tribunal. The scope of challenge, which covers the acts of corrupt and illegal practices committed by or on behalf of the returned candidates in the conduct of the elections, is mentioned in Section 68 of ROPA whereas Section 76A grants suo motu powers to the Election Tribunal to declare election of a returned candidate void on certain grounds which include non-disclosure or incorrect disclosure of assets of the candidate or his spouse or his dependents. \r\n\r\n", "citation": "2016   SCMR  1420", "SCPCitation": "2016 SCP 98", "reported": null, "dateOfAnnouncement": "09-05-2016", "dateCreated": "06-06-2016", "fileSizeInBytes": 20}
