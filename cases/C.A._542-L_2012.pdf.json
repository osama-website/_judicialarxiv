The latter post is an exclusively secular one limited to the matters of management of the shrine alone, whereas on the shoulders of the sajjadanashin rests the responsibility of the spiritual functions of guidance of the mureeds and the performance of rasoomaat etc., which require a person of outstanding character and one capable of leading the community and inspiring the mureeds. Thus this post and the nomination for the same carries immense importance in the hearts of a substantial section of the public and their spiritual guidance/rejuvenation/beliefs rest in the customs and rituals of the shrine, the person who guides these in his capacity as sajjadanashin must therefore be one who is rightfully entitled to the same on the basis of the express declaration/nomination of the Dewan/sajjadanashin who preceded him.", "citation": " \nPLD 2018 SC 343", "SCPCitation": "2018 SCP 15", "reported": null, "dateOfAnnouncement": "22-01-2018", "dateCreated": "13-02-2018", "fileSizeInBytes": 39}
