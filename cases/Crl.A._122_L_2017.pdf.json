JUSTICE QAZI MUHAMMAD AMIN AHMED", "judgmentText": null, "tagline": "Evidence of the last seen is well within the remit of proximity of time and space. Recovery of articles constitutes another strong link particularly last belongings including school bag as well as stationery items. Recovery of sim and generation of calls therefrom, received by the complainant, confirmed by cell phone data presents a formidable piece of evidence, based upon an automated system, immune from foreign interference. Investigative process and conclusion thereof inexorably point towards the appellant?s culpability. Prosecution?s failure of DNA profile generation of rectal and vaginal swabs is a most grievous lapse that in retrospect makes out a case to visit the appellant with alternate penalty of imprisonment for life though amounts of fine and compensation are kept intact.", "citation": "2019   SCMR  1224", "SCPCitation": "2019 SCP 129", "reported": null, "dateOfAnnouncement": "", "dateCreated": "29-05-2019", "fileSizeInBytes": 21}
