Any Commission constituted by the Government or by this Court, any inquiry or investigation conducted by the police or by any other agency and any probe into the matter (of video recording of the trial judge purportedly showing him stating that he was pressurized into convicting the accused) by any other institution or body can only render an opinion in the matter of the relevant video which opinion is treated by the law as irrelevant and it cannot per se be treated as evidence for the benefit of the convict in his pending appeal.
