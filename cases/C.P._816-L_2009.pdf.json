JUSTICE UMAR ATA BANDIAL", "judgmentText": null, "tagline": "There is no order in the decree for payment of interest on the unpaid amount of accrued interest. Interest pendente lite and further interest are both discretionary reliefs granted under section 34, C.P.C. Unless expressly ordered in a decree such interest accrues on principal amount adjudged and not on the aggregate of that amount with accumulated interest. The net effect in the present case is that accrual of interest occurs at simple rate rather than compound rate.", "citation": "2015   SCMR  1461", "SCPCitation": "2015 SCP 88", "reported": null, "dateOfAnnouncement": "05-06-2015", "dateCreated": "04-11-2015", "fileSizeInBytes": 47}
