JUSTICE MIAN SAQIB NISAR", "judgmentText": null, "tagline": "The creation and variation of the limits of districts was not governed by the Constitution but by the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Land Revenue Act, 1967. No bar existed in the Constitution which prevented the limits of districts, whether in relation to a Provincially Administered Tribal Areas or not, from being changed without a constitutional amendment. Variation in the limits of a district did not affect the PATA status of an area, therefore, the tribal areas of one district would remain tribal areas even after they became a part of another district in PATA.", "citation": "PLD 2017 SC  105", "SCPCitation": "2017 SCP 18", "reported": null, "dateOfAnnouncement": "17-01-2017", "dateCreated": "17-01-2017", "fileSizeInBytes": 70}
