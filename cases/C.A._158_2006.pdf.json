JUSTICE MIAN SAQIB NISAR", "judgmentText": null, "tagline": "A statute is not to be applied retrospectively in the absence of express enactment or necessary intendment especially where the statute is to affect vested rights, past and closed transactions or facts or events that have already occurred. The charging section of a fiscal statute is the key and pivotal provision which imposes a fiscal liability upon a taxpayer/person, thus, it should be strictly construed and applied. When companies in question stood excluded from the payment of 'goods exit tax' in terms of the un-amended provision, then any subsequent amendment in such provisions could not be used to collect such tax with retrospective effect.
