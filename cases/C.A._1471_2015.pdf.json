JUSTICE MIAN SAQIB NISAR, HCJ", "judgmentText": null, "tagline": "The judicial determination of the value of a suit for the purposes of court fee and jurisdiction by a judicial forum shall have precedence over the valuation made by the plaintiff and it shall be such valuation which shall be taken into account while determining the forum of appeal from a decree passed in such a suit. All trial courts of the country are directed that separate decree sheets with all the material particulars as per the requirements of Order XX of the C.P.C. must be drawn up where two or more suits have been consolidated and disposed of through a common judgment. Where the decrees passed have different valuations i.e. one falling within the jurisdiction of the High Court and the other in the jurisdiction of the District Court, the appellants are required to file two appeals before the High Court and the District Judge according to the value of the original suit. The learned High Court, however, while exercising its power under Section 24 of the C.P.C. if a case is made out within the purview of the section ibid may transfer the appeal filed before the District Judge to the High Court and decide the same along with the appeal which had been competently filed before the High Court.
