(2) Inordinate or long delay in the conclusion of the trial for no fault of the accused and his protracted detention without determination of his guilt, amount to harassment and abuse of the process of law. Such delay can therefore be a valid ground for releasing the accused on bail and restoring his fundamental right to life and liberty.", "citation": "PLD 2022 SC 497", "SCPCitation": "2022 SCP 166", "reported": null, "dateOfAnnouncement": "19-04-2022", "dateCreated": "17-05-2022", "fileSizeInBytes": 210}
