JUSTICE GULZAR AHMED", "judgmentText": null, "tagline": "The employee being gainfully employed or not while remaining out of service has not always been a reason for granting or non-granting of back benefits. Where the Court reinstates the employee in service, it is not bound to grant back benefits automatically. Rather it is within the discretion of the Court to grant back benefits or not and exercise of such discretion could not be interfered with by the High Court in exercise of writ jurisdiction unless it is shown that such discretion has been exercised without lawful authority and is of no legal effect.  Further, where the Court or the Tribunal has jurisdiction and it determines specific question of fact or even of law, unless patent legal defect or material irregularity is pointed out, such determination cannot ordinarily be interfered with by the High Court while exercising jurisdiction under Article 199 of the Constitution.", "citation": "2019   SCMR  919", "SCPCitation": "2019 SCP 160", "reported": null, "dateOfAnnouncement": "18-04-2019", "dateCreated": "13-07-2019", "fileSizeInBytes": 32}
