JUSTICE MIAN SAQIB NISAR, HCJ", "judgmentText": null, "tagline": "The revisional court is not to dismiss a revision petition for non-prosecution but to decide it on merits only where the court has taken cognizance of the matter of its own, generally called its suo motu powers. When the revisional court decides to take up a matter suo motu, it should have necessarily done so by a conscious application of judicial mind and a thorough examination of the record. Where the revisional court has taken up the matter at the behest of a person, the court has the power to dismiss the civil revision for non-prosecution even after it has been admitted to regular hearing, and is not bound to decide the same on merits.", "citation": "PLD 2016  SC 712", "SCPCitation": "2016 SCP 99", "reported": null, "dateOfAnnouncement": "08-06-2016", "dateCreated": "08-06-2016", "fileSizeInBytes": 85}
