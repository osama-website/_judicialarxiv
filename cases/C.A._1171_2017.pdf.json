Further, the Single Bench of the Sindh High Court at Karachi may take cognizance of any suit arising out of an action/order of the tax authorities/Customs Officers but such jurisdiction must be sparingly exercised by the Single Bench and the suits must be expeditiously decided within the period of one year or less so that these suits are not used by aggrieved parties as a means to deprive the public exchequer of the taxes due for years on the basis of interim injunctions.\r\n\r\n", "citation": "2018   SCMR  1444", "SCPCitation": "2018 SCP 79", "reported": null, "dateOfAnnouncement": "27-06-2018", "dateCreated": "27-06-2018", "fileSizeInBytes": 105}
