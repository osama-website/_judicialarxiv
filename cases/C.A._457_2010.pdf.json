JUSTICE MUNIB AKHTAR", "judgmentText": null, "tagline": "Since the judgment did not exist at the relevant time it could not ipso facto constitute \u201cdefinite information\u201d in the facts and circumstances of the case. It is only a judgment of a Superior Court as available at the relevant time that can constitute \u201cdefinite information\u201d. No such judgment existed when proceedings were initiated under section 65 of the Income Tax Ordinance, 1979 and hence there was no \u201cdefinite information\u201d within the meaning of law that would have made it permissible for the Income Tax Officer to reopen the assessment.", "citation": "2019   SCMR  158", "SCPCitation": "2018 SCP 134", "reported": null, "dateOfAnnouncement": "07-12-2018", "dateCreated": "14-12-2018", "fileSizeInBytes": 33}
