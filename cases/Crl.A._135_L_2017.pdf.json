Though not assigned any harm to the deceased or the witnesses, acquittal of Khawar Ali, Muhammad Boota, Qamar-uz-Zaman, Asad Ullah and Muhammad Luqman stated to be in the company and community of intention with the appellant and acquitted co-accused, firing side by side, does cast a dark shadow upon prosecution?s case.", "citation": "2019   SCMR  1448", "SCPCitation": "2019 SCP 115", "reported": null, "dateOfAnnouncement": "", "dateCreated": "20-05-2019", "fileSizeInBytes": 20}
