In identification parades, the appellants had not been identified with reference to any role played by them. The identification of a culprit during the trial is unsafe. The recovered firearms had not matched with the crime-empties secured from the place of occurrence. The medical evidence could not point towards any particular culprit. The alleged abscondance of one appellant, in the circumstances of the case, is not found to be totally inconsistent with the hypothesis of his innocence. The prosecution had failed to prove its case against the appellants beyond reasonable doubt.
