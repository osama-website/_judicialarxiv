JUSTICE TASSADUQ HUSSAIN JILLANI", "judgmentText": null, "tagline": "A mere advice or suggestion from an international financial institution, which assists and aids developing countries towards economic progress, may not amount to a pressure of the kind to have deprived the competent authority under the law to have taken independent decision. Better performance and rising profits of Habib Bank Limited (HBL) justified the impugned process of sale and made it a credible exercise. Approval of HBL's privatization by the Privatization Committee was within the purview of Privatization Commission and the whole process did not reflect violation of any statutory provision. Process of privatization was neither tainted with lack of transparency or mala fides nor the successful bidder lacked qualifications prescribed in law.\r\n\r\n", "citation": "2012   SCMR  455", "SCPCitation": "2012 SCP 11", "reported": null, "dateOfAnnouncement": "29-11-2011", "dateCreated": "08-02-2012", "fileSizeInBytes": 222}
