Collector of Customs, Sales Tax & Central Excise.", "caseFileName": "C.A._725_2008.pdf", "authorJudge": "Mr. Justice Munib Akhtar", "judgmentText": null, "tagline": "The fact that no provision existed under the Central Excises Act, 1944 for recovery of the deemed arrear of duty under s. 3-D did not mean that it could not be recovered at all. Any amount of duty or tax is, ultimately, a debt owed to the Government by the person who is liable to pay the same. It can therefore be recovered as any debt can by any person, i.e., by way of suit. Of course, Government hardly ever needs to take recourse to remedy by way of suit because the relevant fiscal legislation provides for specific and tailor made methods, which are far more effective as means of recovery.  Remedy by way of suit is not barred for the Government. Thus, the proper remedy in respect of the facts and circumstances at hand would have been for the Government to file a suit for recovery of the deemed arrear of duty, for which the period of limitation would be as provided for under Article 149.", "citation": "PLD 2019 SC 583", "SCPCitation": "2019 SCP 137", "reported": null, "dateOfAnnouncement": "31-01-2019", "dateCreated": "18-06-2019", "fileSizeInBytes": 45}
