JUSTICE MIAN SAQIB NISAR, HCJ", "judgmentText": null, "tagline": "The factors to be considered by a special court before the assumption of jurisdiction are firstly whether it has jurisdiction over the subject matter of the lis and secondly whether the parties to the lis are subject to its jurisdiction. When the appellant bank and the respondents are present in Pakistan then it is the courts in Pakistan which must assume jurisdiction. The primary consideration before the Court must be where the ends of justice in the case will be best served. The governing law at the time unequivocally recognised interest based loans as being legally binding and treated the same as recoverable under the law, therefore, the assertion that the transaction(s) in question were void under Section 23 of the Contract Act for not having a lawful purpose, is entirely flawed and illogical.", "citation": "PLD 2018 SC 795", "SCPCitation": "2018 SCP 100", "reported": null, "dateOfAnnouncement": "02-07-2018", "dateCreated": "28-08-2018", "fileSizeInBytes": 81}
