JUSTICE MIAN SAQIB NISAR", "judgmentText": null, "tagline": "The arbitration clause impliedly provides for the appointment of a sole arbitrator with the consent of both the parties. Admittedly no application was ever made to the Court, and consequently, as the mandate of law prescribed by Section 8 of the Arbitration Act, 1940, was not followed by the respondent, the award passed by the arbitrator cannot be deemed to be valid. Further, the parties cannot confer jurisdiction upon a Court or other judicial or quasi-judicial forum through consent which otherwise in law would have no jurisdiction and such being an inherent defect cannot be cured on the rules of consent, waiver, estoppel, acquiescence etc. ", "citation": "PLD 2016 SC 121", "SCPCitation": "2016 SCP 9", "reported": null, "dateOfAnnouncement": "02-10-2015", "dateCreated": "06-01-2016", "fileSizeInBytes": 85}
