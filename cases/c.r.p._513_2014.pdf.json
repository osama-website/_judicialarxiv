JUSTICE SYED MANSOOR ALI SHAH", "judgmentText": null, "tagline": "Section 9 of the Criminal Law (Special Court) Act, 1976 (the Act) envisages that once the trial has begun, it shall not be adjourned by reason of absence of the accused. If the accused voluntarily chooses not to exercise his right to appear and to be present at trial, it does not infringe the fairness of the trial nor does it violate the right to fair trial under Article 10A of the Constitution. The accused has been declared a proclaimed offender and being a fugitive from the law loses the right of audience. The Special Court shall proceed with the trial on the next date of hearing. In case the accused surrenders and appears before the Court, constituted under the Act, for the charge of high treason, he would be entitled to record his statement under section 342, CrPC. and lead any other defence under the law. However, in case the accused fails to appear on the next date of hearing, being a proclaimed offender, the Special Court is empowered to proceed against the accused even in his absence under section 9 of the Act.\r\n", "citation": "2019   SCMR  1029", "SCPCitation": "2019 SCP 191", "reported": null, "dateOfAnnouncement": "01-04-2019", "dateCreated": "24-08-2019", "fileSizeInBytes": 493}
