The present occurrence was a direct result of the grave provocation offered by the complainant party but such provocation was no longer sudden at the time of the present occurrence and, therefore, the case in hand did not fall squarely within the ambit of section 302(c), PPC. As the appellant had acted under the influence of his father we have felt persuaded to reduce the sentence of death passed against him to imprisonment for life.\r\n\r\n", "citation": "PLJ 2017 SC 137", "SCPCitation": "2017 SCP 1", "reported": null, "dateOfAnnouncement": "23-11-2016", "dateCreated": "04-01-2017", "fileSizeInBytes": 24}
