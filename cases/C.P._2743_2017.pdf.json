The Labour Laws (Amendment) Ordinance, 2001 (\u201c2001 Ordinance\u201d) has expanded the scope of the 1936 Act manifold. There never was, and certainly after the 2001 Ordinance no longer is, any requirement that the claimant establish himself to be a \"workman\".\r\n", "citation": "2019   PLC  51", "SCPCitation": "2018 SCP 114", "reported": null, "dateOfAnnouncement": "03-10-2018", "dateCreated": "03-10-2018", "fileSizeInBytes": 53}
