The objection was recorded but the Magistrates surprisingly did not attend to it, which constituted a serious lapse on their part. The prosecution witnesses who identified the accused persons before the Trial Court had a number of opportunities to see the accused persons before their statements were recorded. Neither the Forensic Science Laboratory nor any of the policemen, who had retrieved the bullet and its casing and had kept them in custody and then delivered them to the Laboratory, mentioned the marks affixed on the seals affixed on the parcels in which the said items were delivered to and received by the Laboratory.", "citation": "2017   SCMR  524", "SCPCitation": "2017 SCP 44", "reported": null, "dateOfAnnouncement": "20-01-2017", "dateCreated": "08-03-2017", "fileSizeInBytes": 33}
