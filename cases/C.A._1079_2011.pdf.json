JUSTICE MIAN SAQIB NISAR, HCJ", "judgmentText": null, "tagline": "Subsection (2) of S. 18 of the Customs Act, 1969 provides the general rule that all goods exported from Pakistan shall not be charged with export duty whereas subsection (3) provides the exception to such general rule in that it specifically authorizes the Federal Government to impose a regulatory duty by notification in the official Gazette on all or any of the goods imported or exported. A combined reading of both the sub-sections makes it abundantly clear that neither do they conflict with each other nor does either have supremacy over the other. Notification issued by the Federal Government under S. 18(3) of the Customs Act, 1969 imposing a regulatory duty on certain export items is valid and legal and such duty would be chargeable from the date of the notification. Relevant date for determination of the rate of regulatory duty on exported goods is the date when the \"goods declaration\" is delivered or filed. Exported goods for which the declarations are filed on or after the date of the notification imposing regulatory duty are liable to regulatory duty as envisaged by the notification.", "citation": "2017   SCMR  1714", "SCPCitation": "2017 SCP 86", "reported": null, "dateOfAnnouncement": "17-05-2017", "dateCreated": "25-07-2017", "fileSizeInBytes": 48}
