In contrast, the Off-Highway dump truck is specifically designed for use in difficult terrains where the activities of mining, quarrying or construction of big buildings are carried out. Volvo FM 400 trucks that were imported by the respondent companies, being On-Highway trucks and not Off-Highway dump trucks, were rightly treated by the Appraisement Collectorate of the Customs as not being a part of the plant of a cement factory.", "citation": "2016   SCMR  1982", "SCPCitation": "2016 SCP 116", "reported": null, "dateOfAnnouncement": "27-04-2016", "dateCreated": "04-08-2016", "fileSizeInBytes": 30}
