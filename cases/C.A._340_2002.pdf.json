Thus, it seems quite strange and unreasonable that through impugned judgment, the learned Division Bench of the High Court had done away with the conditionality of such sentences to run consecutively while exercising writ jurisdiction under Article 199 of the Constitution, which is equitable and discretionary in nature and not meant to give premium to a criminal for commission of heinous crime.", "citation": "PLD 2016 SC 65", "SCPCitation": "2015 SCP 101", "reported": null, "dateOfAnnouncement": "28-10-2015", "dateCreated": "28-11-2015", "fileSizeInBytes": 66}
