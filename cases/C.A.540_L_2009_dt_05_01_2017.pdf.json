JUSTICE MIAN SAQIB NISAR", "judgmentText": null, "tagline": "Where possession has not been delivered and/or the sale deed has been executed but not registered as yet, a pre-emptor, of a suit for pre-emption under the Punjab Pre-emption Act, 1913, would have no notice that sale had taken place, thereby enabling him to exercise his right. In such cases the 'first part' of Article 10 of the Limitation Act, 1908 would have no application; rather the case(s) would fall within the 'second part' thereof. The period of limitation for the cases falling in the 'second part' of Article 10 will be one year from when the sale instrument is registered and not from the date of its execution.\r\n", "citation": "2017   SCMR  376", "SCPCitation": "2017 SCP 13", "reported": null, "dateOfAnnouncement": "05-01-2017", "dateCreated": "05-01-2017", "fileSizeInBytes": 191}
