JUSTICE QAZI MUHAMMAD AMIN AHMED", "judgmentText": null, "tagline": "It is most intriguing as to why the appellant who consistently hid himself over a long period of time, finally dispatched a copy of National Identity Card so as to voluntarily rope himself in a case. Evidence of extrajudicial confession, in the absence of any incriminatory evidence thenceforth, is really mindboggling. The inflammatory material had been handed over to the police after the appellant's arrest without any plausible explanation as to why the complainant retained it with him for a period exceeding two years. A weak piece of evidence cannot corroborate another weak piece of evidence. Absconsion cannot be viewed as a proof for the crime. The appellant's declaration of faith is to be preferred over divergent imputations. Citizen regardless of religion are equal before law and entitled to equal protection. A criminal charge is to be essentially settled on positive proof alone and not on perceptional or optical paradigms.", "citation": "2019   SCMR  1994", "SCPCitation": "2019 SCP 218", "reported": null, "dateOfAnnouncement": "25-09-2019", "dateCreated": "08-10-2019", "fileSizeInBytes": 31}
