The appointing Authority has to make promotions in basic pay scales 20 and 21 only upon the recommendations of the Central Selection Board. Yet the law does not provide that the recommendations of the Board are binding and consequently be returned by the appointing Authority only when the procedure followed by the Board suffers from any factual or legal flaw.
