The exemption was never meant for the taxpayers like the petitioners whose businesses fall within the domain of \u2018final tax regime\u2019 for whom the question of experiencing loss of business opportunity on account of internal strife does not arise. They made their presence in the affected area only when they had in their hands a business opportunity to make profits and gains in the form of contracts to be executed there. \r\n", "citation": "2017   SCMR  822", "SCPCitation": "2017 SCP 59", "reported": null, "dateOfAnnouncement": "26-01-2017", "dateCreated": "28-03-2017", "fileSizeInBytes": 41}
