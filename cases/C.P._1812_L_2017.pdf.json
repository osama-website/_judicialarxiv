JUSTICE FAISAL ARAB", "judgmentText": null, "tagline": "Bilateral agreements cannot be read into the proviso of section 18(5) of the Customs Act. The earlier SRO was not in relation to grant of exemption from regulatory duty on goods covered under Free Trade Agreement. It only imposed regulatory duty on certain items which did not cover goods that were part of Free Trade Agreement. The Government was well within its right to impose regulatory duty on such goods as well at any stage. It was not necessary at all to first withdraw the exception granted earlier in SRO whereby the regulatory duty was imposed only on goods not covered under the Free Trade Agreement.\r\n", "citation": "2018   SCMR  1", "SCPCitation": "2018 SCP 109", "reported": null, "dateOfAnnouncement": "22-07-2017", "dateCreated": "27-09-2018", "fileSizeInBytes": 25}
