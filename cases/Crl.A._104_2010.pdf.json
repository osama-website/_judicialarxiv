JUSTICE DOST MUHAMMAD KHAN", "judgmentText": null, "tagline": "Mens rea, an essential ingredient of every crime, in cases of terrorism becomes twofold i.e. the first object is to commit a crime, while the primary object in the second fold speaks of terrorism related ideology, purpose and object, the most nefarious and detestable designs to commit crimes, creating sense of fear, insecurity and instability in the society and community with the ultimate object to destabilize the State as a whole. The mere fact that the crimes for personal motive are committed in a gruesome or detestable manner by itself would not be sufficient to bring the acts within the meaning of terrorism. The Court while interpreting a special law had to look at the reasons and background which influenced the mind of the legislature in enacting the special law, and the history of events, which had occurred preceding the enactment of the special law. Widening the scope of such Statutes would defeat the legislative intent. Whenever Penal Statute requires interpretation then, it shall be so interpreted, which favours the accused person and not the State. If any citizen is triable under the ordinary penal law of the land, then, treating him harshly under special law, not clearly applicable to him, would be a violation of the command of the Constitution.", "citation": "2017   SCMR  1572", "SCPCitation": "2017 SCP 84", "reported": null, "dateOfAnnouncement": "04-05-2017", "dateCreated": "22-06-2017", "fileSizeInBytes": 72}
