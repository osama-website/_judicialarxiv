The catchphrase and expression \"two wrongs don't make a right\" symbolizes a philosophical benchmark in which a wrongdoing is made level or countered with another wrongdoing. In fact this maxim is used to reprimand or repudiate an unlawful deed as a reaction to another\u2019s misdemeanor. A wrong order or benefit cannot become a foundation for avowing equality or equal opportunity for enforcement of treatment alike rather such right should be founded on a legitimate and legally implementable right. A wrong order cannot be allowed to carry on which hardly confers any right to claim parity or equality. The respondent could not claim that if something wrong has been done in the case of Zahid Arif, therefore, the same direction should be given in his case also for committing another wrong which would not be setting a wrong to right but would be moving ahead and perpetuating another wrong which is disapproved and highly deprecated. No case of any sort of discrimination is made out. The concept of equal treatment could not be pressed into service by the respondent which presupposes and deduces the existence of right and remedy structured on legal foothold and not on wrong notion or whims.
