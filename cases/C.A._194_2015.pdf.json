Minimum criteria or the essential pre-requisites for satisfying the conscience of the Court for permitting a recount was that there should be specific allegation of tampering, manipulation and maneuvering. Election Tribunal should keep in mind that secrecy of the ballot should not be violated on the basis of frivolous, vague and totally unfounded allegations and that the primary object should be to do full justice in the matter.", "citation": "2016   SCMR  251", "SCPCitation": "2015 SCP 102", "reported": null, "dateOfAnnouncement": "12-11-2015", "dateCreated": "30-11-2015", "fileSizeInBytes": 75}
