However, section 23(1) of the Act restricts the making of such rules \"for carrying out the purpose of this Act.\" The Act mentions the appointment, probation and confirmation of civil servants (sections 4, 5 and 6 respectively) but it does not stipulate, nor envisages, the contravention or abandonment of these provisions. Subordinate legislation cannot contravene the law, however, the manner in which rule 23 of the Rules was applied to induct the petitioners as regular civil servants did just that.\r\n", "citation": "2018 SCMR 1120", "SCPCitation": "2018 SCP 54", "reported": null, "dateOfAnnouncement": "23-04-2018", "dateCreated": "24-04-2018", "fileSizeInBytes": 96}
