As regards the question as to whether runner-up can be declared as a successful candidate, it is held that as disqualification was not notorious, therefore, the doctrine of \u201cthrow away votes\u201d would not be applicable. The election as a whole of the constituency is declared bad and the Election Commission is directed to conduct fresh election.\r\n", "citation": "PLD 2006  SC 78", "SCPCitation": "2005 SCP 7", "reported": null, "dateOfAnnouncement": "12-10-2005", "dateCreated": "12-10-2005", "fileSizeInBytes": 564}
