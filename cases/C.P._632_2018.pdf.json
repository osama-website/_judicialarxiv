It does not provide that if the stipulated timeframe is not adhered to by Accountability Court in the matter of conclusion of a trial then the prosecution of the accused person would stand terminated and he would be deemed to have been acquitted or that the accused person would be entitled to be admitted to bail on such ground. Ordinarily bail is allowed to an accused person on the ground of delay only where the delay in the trial or the period of custody of the accused person is shocking, unconscionable or inordinate and not otherwise. The primary consideration for grant of bail on the ground of such delay is undue hardship and more often than not prima facie merits of the case against the accused person are also looked into before admitting him to bail on the ground of delay.", "citation": "PLD 2019 SC 112", "SCPCitation": "2018 SCP 125", "reported": null, "dateOfAnnouncement": "01-10-2018", "dateCreated": "12-11-2018", "fileSizeInBytes": 83}
