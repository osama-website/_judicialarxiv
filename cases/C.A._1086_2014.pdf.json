JUSTICE MIAN SAQIB NISAR", "judgmentText": null, "tagline": "Sections 68 and 69 of the Representation of the People Act, 1976 constitute a two-pronged test, both limbs of which must be satisfied by any election petitioner challenging the election of the returned candidate, if he wishes to be declared duly elected in place of such returned candidate. The rules of proof for the grounds challenging the election which are founded on corrupt and illegal practices are quite strict and stringent and the allegations in this regard must be absolutely proved through positive evidence without accepting any inferences and if there is any doubt, the benefit must go to the person against whom corrupt or illegal practices are being alleged. A bare perusal of the findings of the learned Tribunal vis-\u00e0-vis polling station no. 29 clearly suggests that it has concluded that the evidence indicates committal of illegal practices in connivance and collusion with the returned candidate based on pure inference and conjecture, without ruling out all the possibilities in light of the circumstantial evidence and without correctly appreciating the evidence and properly applying the law on the matter.", "citation": "PLD 2016 SC 79", "SCPCitation": "2016 SCP 10", "reported": null, "dateOfAnnouncement": "19-11-2015", "dateCreated": "06-01-2016", "fileSizeInBytes": 69}
