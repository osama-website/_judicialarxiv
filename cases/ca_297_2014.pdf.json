Since the delimitation of constituencies of the Local Government is part of the process of organizing and holding elections honestly, justly and fairly which is the constitutional mandate of ECP, the power to carry out such delimitation should vest with ECP. Sections 8 to 10 of the Punjab Local Government Act, 2013 and the relevant Rules framed there-under are ultra vires of the Constitution in so far as they empower the Provincial Government to carry out the delimitation of the constituencies for the Local Government. \r\n", "citation": "PLD 2014 SC 463", "SCPCitation": "2014 SCP 24", "reported": null, "dateOfAnnouncement": "19-03-2014", "dateCreated": "19-03-2014", "fileSizeInBytes": 15}
