(2) The claim of antedated promotion w.e.f. 2004 was not permissible due to non-availability of post. (3) The adjustment could only be possible in case the post was abolished/redundant, or the appellant was found surplus or sent to a surplus pool due to any reorganizational or restructuring steps. (4) The expression up-gradation is disparate and incongruent to the term promotion. (5) A wrong benefit extended beyond the scope of law and rules/policy cannot be claimed in perpetuity or eternity.", "citation": "2022 SCMR 797", "SCPCitation": "2022 SCP 34", "reported": null, "dateOfAnnouncement": "27-01-2022", "dateCreated": "03-02-2022", "fileSizeInBytes": 38}
