JUSTICE QAZI FAEZ ISA", "judgmentText": null, "tagline": "The legal process was abused by keeping the Reference pending indefinitely and unreasonably. The Chairman of the National Accountability Bureau, for over four years, did not submit an application for the restoration/revival of the Reference. The learned Judges of the High Court were justified to quash the Reference and once it was quashed the question of reinvestigation did not arise. The petition for leave to appeal was time-barred by 1,229 days and no purpose would be served to condone such unreasonable and unjustified delay.", "citation": "PLD 2018 SC 296", "SCPCitation": "2018 SCP 3", "reported": null, "dateOfAnnouncement": "05-01-2018", "dateCreated": "05-01-2018", "fileSizeInBytes": 131}
