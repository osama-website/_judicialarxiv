JUSTICE DOST MUHAMMAD KHAN", "judgmentText": null, "tagline": "For placing reliance on circumstantial evidence, in cases involving capital punishment, such evidence must be of the nature, where, all circumstances must be so inter-linked, making out a single unbroken chain, where one end of the same touches the dead body and the other the neck of the accused. Retracted confession, if corroborated by independent evidence of reliable nature, could be made basis for conviction on a capital charge. For accepting a confession, two essential requirements must be fulfilled; first, that the confession was made voluntarily and was based on true account of facts leading to the crime and, second, the same was proved at the trial. Motive belatedly set up appeared to be self-manufactured with the connivance of the police. The medical evidence is only confirmatory or of supporting nature and is never held to be corroboratory evidence, to identify the culprit(s). Even a single doubt, if found reasonable, would entitle the accused person to acquittal and not a combination of several doubts.\r\n\r\n", "citation": "2017   SCMR  986", "SCPCitation": "2017 SCP 67", "reported": null, "dateOfAnnouncement": "12-04-2017", "dateCreated": "19-04-2017", "fileSizeInBytes": 49}
