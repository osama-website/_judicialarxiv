JUSTICE JAVED IQBAL", "judgmentText": null, "tagline": " The applicants i.e. Judges of High Courts who were affected by the Court\u2019s judgment dated 31.07.2009, which had declared the actions of proclamation of emergency of 03.11.2007 as un-constitutional and void ab initio, seek permission to get the judgment reviewed, on the ground, inter alia, that they had been condemned unheard. The Court observes that no stricture was passed qua their eligibility, integrity, entitlement, qualifications and besides that their removal from the office of Judges does not amount to be a stigma and, therefore, the doctrine of \u2018audi alteram partem\u2019 cannot be pressed into service which otherwise is not universally recognized due to certain limitations. The applicants had no vested right to be heard and furthermore they had acted illegally and in violation of the order dated 03.11.2007 of 7-Member Bench of the Supreme Court for obtaining illegal gains and benefits which cannot be ignored while examining the principle of \u2018audi alteram partem\u2019. The reviews are not maintainable.\r\n", "citation": "PLD 2010 SC 483", "SCPCitation": "2009 SCP 12", "reported": null, "dateOfAnnouncement": "", "dateCreated": "13-10-2009", "fileSizeInBytes": 240}
