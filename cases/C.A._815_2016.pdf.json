However, S. 4(4) of the Act read with R. 14(3) of the Punjab Agricultural Income Rules, 2001 (?the Rules?) clearly allow for the recovery of agricultural income tax for two years prior to the assessment year. Moreover, application of S. 3B of the Act is predicated upon the agricultural income as declared by the assessee himself in his income tax return, therefore, in cases where the assessee has himself filed his income tax return in which he has declared his agricultural income, by virtue of S. 3B of the Act, the tax department is not required to levy and assess agricultural income tax in terms of S. 3 and could recover the same by issuing recovery notices directly. However, where an assessee has not filed his income tax return or has done so without disclosing his agricultural income, then the tax authorities are obliged to levy, assess and collect agricultural income tax (in spite of the presence of S. 3B) in terms of Ss. 3 & 4 of the Act and R. 14(1) of the Rules.", "citation": "KLR 2019 Supreme Court 264", "SCPCitation": "2019 SCP 23", "reported": null, "dateOfAnnouncement": "08-01-2019", "dateCreated": "27-02-2019", "fileSizeInBytes": 99}
