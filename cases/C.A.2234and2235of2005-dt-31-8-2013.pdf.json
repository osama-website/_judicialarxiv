The protection of Article 25 of the Constitution  can  be  denied  in  peculiar  circumstances  of  the  case on the basis  of  reasonable  classification founded  on  an  intelligible differentia which distinguishes persons or things that are grouped together from those who have been left out. The differentia, however, must have rational nexus to the object sought to be achieved by such classification. The classification between the students, who secured more marks and succeeded in getting admission on open merit and the students, who, after failing to get admission on open merit, opted to get the benefit of Self Finance Scheme, is based on an intelligible differentia as such reasonable. \r\n", "citation": "2013 SCMR 1687", "SCPCitation": "2013 SCP 108", "reported": null, "dateOfAnnouncement": "31-07-2013", "dateCreated": "31-07-2013", "fileSizeInBytes": 120}
