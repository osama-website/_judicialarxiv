JUSTICE EJAZ AFZAL KHAN", "judgmentText": null, "tagline": "The grant of the land to Malir Development Authority, its exchange with the land of the Bahria Town and anything done pursuant thereto being against the provisions of Colonization of Government Lands Act 1912 (\u201cCOGLA 1912\u201d) and statement of conditions are void ab initio and as such have no existence. The government land would go back to the government and the land of the Bahria Town exchanged for the government land would go back to the Bahria Town. Since a great deal of work has been done by the Bahria Town and a third-party interest has been created in favour of hundreds of allotees, the land could be granted to the Bahria Town afresh by the Board of Revenue under the provisions of COGLA 1912 and the questions in this regard will be determined by the implementation bench of this Court. National Accountability Bureau shall take its investigation to its logical end. \r\n", "citation": "PLD 2018 SC 468", "SCPCitation": "2018 SCP 60", "reported": null, "dateOfAnnouncement": "05-04-2018", "dateCreated": "04-05-2018", "fileSizeInBytes": 338}
