JUSTICE FAISAL ARAB", "judgmentText": null, "tagline": "Disputed sale transactions are based on oral statements purportedly made by the deceased before the revenue authorities and allegedly witnessed by persons none of whom was from the side of the deceased. The disputed statements of the witnesses neither contain their CNIC numbers nor their addresses, but only their purported thumb impressions, which show that they were illiterate. None of the witnesses of the disputed statements was examined in Court. Examination of the register of Village Form VII shows that the page that contained one of the two disputed transfer entries was apparently subsequently inserted. It is sufficient to hold that the transaction of sale has not been proved.", "citation": "2019   SCMR  70", "SCPCitation": "2018 SCP 128", "reported": null, "dateOfAnnouncement": "07-09-2018", "dateCreated": "23-11-2018", "fileSizeInBytes": 23}
