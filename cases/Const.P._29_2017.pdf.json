AZMAT SAEED", "judgmentText": null, "tagline": "The Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) is a unique forum created by the Constitution. It is not a Court but more akin to a Domestic Disciplinary Tribunal whose proceedings are administrative in nature and recommendatory in effect, but its findings have an element of conclusiveness. Paragraphs 7 and 13 of the SJC Procedure of Enquiry, 2005 are intra vires to the Constitution. The process of determination whether any prima facie case has been made for proceedings under Article 209 of the Constitution should be held in camera and the subsequent proceedings should also be held in camera unless the person being inquired into waives such right. However, in camera proceedings are not alien to our jurisprudence and can always be resorted to by the SJC even in the absence of the consent of the parties for well defined reasons.", "citation": "PLD 2018 SC 538", "SCPCitation": "2018 SCP 64", "reported": null, "dateOfAnnouncement": "28-03-2018", "dateCreated": "10-05-2018", "fileSizeInBytes": 232}
