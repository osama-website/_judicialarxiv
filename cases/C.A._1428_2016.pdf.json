JUSTICE MIAN SAQIB NISAR", "judgmentText": null, "tagline": "The Rules of Business, 1973 are binding on the Government and a failure to follow them would lead to an order lacking any legal validity. The Federal Government is the collective entity described as the Cabinet constituting the Prime Minister and Federal Ministers. Neither a Secretary, nor a Minister and nor the Prime Minister are the Federal Government and the exercise, or purported exercise, of a statutory power exercisable by the Federal Government by any of them, especially, in relation to fiscal matters, is constitutionally invalid and a nullity in the eyes of the law. Similarly, budgetary expenditure, or discretionary governmental expenditure can only be authorized by the Federal Government i.e. the Cabinet, and not the Prime Minister on his own.\r\n", "citation": "PLD 2016 SC 808", "SCPCitation": "2016 SCP 122", "reported": null, "dateOfAnnouncement": "18-08-2016", "dateCreated": "18-08-2016", "fileSizeInBytes": 231}
