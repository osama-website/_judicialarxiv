The Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) also comes in as a consultee in his capacity as a guardian and defender of the constitutional and legal rights of the people at large. The role of CJP as a neutral arbiter in disagreements, differences or disputes over matters of national importance already stands recognized through Articles 152 and 159(4) of the Constitution.\r\n", "citation": "PLD 2011 SC 365", "SCPCitation": "2011 SCP 11", "reported": null, "dateOfAnnouncement": "10-03-2011", "dateCreated": "10-03-2011", "fileSizeInBytes": 113}
