JUSTICE MUNIB AKHTAR", "judgmentText": null, "tagline": "The provisions regarding departmental appeals/representations and review in the relevant rules fall into two categories. One category is of the Federation and the Punjab, while the other is that of Balochistan, Sindh and KPK. In the latter category, if the departmental appeal/representation/review is filed beyond the prescribed period, then the delay may be condoned if reasonable cause is shown while in the first category, the appeal may be ?withheld? if filed after the prescribed period and the appellant is unable to show any reasonable cause for the delay. Thus, in both categories, a departmental appeal is not to be dismissed outright if beyond time; the delay can be condoned.  The law needs to be settled and made certain. The Office may place this appeal before the Hon?ble Chief Justice for such orders as are deemed appropriate.
