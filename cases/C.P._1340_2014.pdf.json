JUSTICE DOST MUHAMMAD KHAN", "judgmentText": null, "tagline": "An accused person cannot be left at the mercy of the prosecution to rot in jail for an indefinite period. The inordinate delay in the conclusion of trial of detained prisoners cannot be lightly ignored provided it was not caused due to any act or omission of accused. Despite the exclusion clause, beneficial provision of section 497 Cr.P.C. can be pressed into service in some genuine and rare cases to provide relief of grant of bail to a highly deserving accused, incarcerated in prison for a longer duration. There is also a long chain of authorities and dicta of this Court where bail has been granted on account of shocking delay in the conclusion of trial in cases falling under the NAB laws.\r\n", "citation": "2015   SCMR  1092", "SCPCitation": "2015 SCP 28", "reported": null, "dateOfAnnouncement": "14-04-2015", "dateCreated": "29-05-2015", "fileSizeInBytes": 29}
