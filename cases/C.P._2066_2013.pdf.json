Registrar of Trade Marks, Trade Mark Registry, Karachi & another", "caseFileName": "C.P._2066_2013.pdf", "authorJudge": "Mr. Justice Mushir Alam", "judgmentText": null, "tagline": "The petitioners have adopted the trade mark \"FAROOQ'S Hayat\" which encompasses the mark \"HAYAT\" and is the striking or dominating feature of the trade mark of IFFCO. Adoption of dominant feature being \"HAYAT\" is not only strikingly similar but is identical. Merely adding prefix of \"FAROOQ'S\" in inconspicuous manner to the dominant or striking feature of the existing trademark HAYAT is of no consequence. The prefix \"FAROOQ'S\" as used by the petitioner does not eclipse, overshadow or obscure the dominating mark HAYAT in a way that may distinguish his goods with that of the goods of the IFFCO. If the competing trade mark of the petitioner is allowed registration, it would not only be encouraging unscrupulous traders to steal someone else's goodwill and (intellectual) property, but at the same time unwary purchaser would be exposed to more than reasonable probabilities of confusion and deception. \r\n", "citation": "2015   SCMR  1230", "SCPCitation": "2015 SCP 33", "reported": null, "dateOfAnnouncement": "20-01-2015", "dateCreated": "26-06-2015", "fileSizeInBytes": 47}
