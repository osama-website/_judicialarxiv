In the case in hand, the court cannot get rid of or brush aside it unless some other cogent reasons or extenuating circumstances are available to discard and dislodge such opinion to come to another judicious and sagacious conclusion. The benefit of doubt can be extended to the accused even at bail stage if the facts of the case so warrant. The insight and astuteness of further inquiry is a question which must have some nexus with the result of the case for which a tentative assessment of the material on record is to be considered for reaching just conclusion. The case of further inquiry pre-supposes the tentative assessment which may create doubt with respect to the involvement of accused in the crime. Whether the petitioners have made out a case of further inquiry or not, the court has to glean and congregate the composite effect of incriminating material brought on record by the prosecution, inconsistency or contradiction if any in the statement made in the FIR vis-\u00e0-vis postmortem report and or the situation where ocular evidence is not supported by the medical evidence.
