In such circumstances, where unqualified or disqualified person manages to escape through the net and trespass into the Majlis-e-Shoora or the Provincial Assembly, the Constitutional jurisdiction of the learned High Court under Article 199 of the Constitution and of this Court under Article 184(3) of the Constitution can always be invoked.", "citation": "PLD 2018 SC 449", "SCPCitation": "2018 SCP 61", "reported": null, "dateOfAnnouncement": "23-02-2018", "dateCreated": "04-05-2018", "fileSizeInBytes": 111}
