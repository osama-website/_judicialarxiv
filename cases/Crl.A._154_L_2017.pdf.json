JUSTICE QAZI MUHAMMAD AMIN AHMED", "judgmentText": null, "tagline": "Totality of circumstances does not space any hypothesis other than appellant?s guilt, however, quantum of sentence warrants reconsideration. The appellant attended the Court to record his statement as a witness and it is subsequent thereto that as many as six accused started firing upon the deceased and the PWs, two from amongst them have since been exonerated, never tried even through private complaint; Muhammad Mushtaq alongwith two unknown accomplices is still away from law; appellant?s acquittal from the charge of attempted homicide has not been challenged. Appellant himself sustained injuries receipt whereof is denied by the prosecution witnesses. These circumstances cloud moments immediately preceding the occurrence into mystery, particularly when in the given background, the appellant had no exclusive motive, targeted upon the deceased. In this backdrop, as a cumulative impact, alteration of death penalty into imprisonment for life would not be \r\nunconscionable in circumstances.\r\n", "citation": "PLD 2019 SC 580", "SCPCitation": "2019 SCP 139", "reported": null, "dateOfAnnouncement": "", "dateCreated": "18-06-2019", "fileSizeInBytes": 20}
