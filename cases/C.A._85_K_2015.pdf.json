Gulzar Ahmed and others", "caseFileName": "C.A._85_K_2015.pdf", "authorJudge": "MR. JUSTICE MUNIB AKHTAR", "judgmentText": null, "tagline": "The 1990 Agreement, which provides that employee became redundant can be employed somewhere else and not to make redundant, must be read as a whole and interpreted in the light of well-established rules. When so considered, it appears that the agreement was intended to deal with certain immediate issues of concern peculiar to Jang Karachi. It was not intended to be an omnibus agreement, applicable generally to the workmen of the Jang Group.\r\nThe termination of services of a newspaper employee, who is a workman, for the reason that his services have become redundant because of modernization or technological changes and developments is a ?good cause? within the meaning of s. 4. It would certainly appear to be a valid ground for terminating the services of a workman in terms of the 1968 Ordinance and the 1969 Ordinance. \r\n", "citation": "2018   SCMR  1626", "SCPCitation": "2018 SCP 89", "reported": null, "dateOfAnnouncement": "20-06-2018", "dateCreated": "13-07-2018", "fileSizeInBytes": 42}
