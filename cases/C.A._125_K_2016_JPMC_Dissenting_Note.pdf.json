Interpretation of constitutional provisions should thus be in consonance with the said principle rather than in a manner that encroaches upon the space reserved for the provinces. The Court should therefore avoid an expansive construction of a federal legislative power which renders redundant or nugatory the legislative field, power and authority assigned to the provinces, either expressly or as residuary, thus undermining provincial autonomy. Disregarding the mandatory provisions of the Constitution and the categorical mandate prescribed thereunder would embolden and encourage those who are averse to the rule of law and have scant regard for the supremacy of the Constitution, thereby strengthening those who want to create dissention and discord in our national polity.", "citation": "2020   SCMR  1", "SCPCitation": "2019 SCP 134", "reported": null, "dateOfAnnouncement": "17-01-2019", "dateCreated": "30-05-2019", "fileSizeInBytes": 105}
