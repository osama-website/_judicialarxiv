JUSTICE MUNIB AKHTAR", "judgmentText": null, "tagline": "The standard of proof in election matters is much higher than the civil standard (balance of probabilities) though short of the criminal standard (beyond reasonable doubt). Recourse by the Court to Article 84 of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 for visual examination of photographs and signatures was contrary to the dictates of the requisite standard of proof. The Court sets aside the judgment under review and directs that the petitioner shall be entitled to file her nomination papers if she intends to contest in any of the future elections.\r\n", "citation": "2018   SCMR  1432", "SCPCitation": "2018 SCP 81", "reported": null, "dateOfAnnouncement": "09-06-2018", "dateCreated": "29-06-2018", "fileSizeInBytes": 43}
