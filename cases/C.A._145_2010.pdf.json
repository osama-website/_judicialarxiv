Commissioner of Income Tax/ Wealth Tax Islamabad", "caseFileName": "C.A._145_2010.pdf", "authorJudge": "Mr. Justice Qazi Faez Isa", "judgmentText": null, "tagline": "The appellant, a government owned private limited company, was transferred two state owned entities on cost basis through a decision taken by the PM which was later recalled. It during the relevant period has shown the rental income as ?Income from business or profession? and paid income tax accordingly. The department however considered that the income from the properties was ?Income from house property? and attracted a higher income tax rate. This Court holds that the appellant was wrongly declared the owner, learned High Court wrongly extended the meaning of ?owner? and ?sale? to create liability under two fiscal statutes by disregarding the provisions of the Income Tax Ordinance and the Wealth Tax Act.
