IJAZ AHMED", "judgmentText": null, "tagline": "Rules are not presently available for promotion to the selection grade of BS-22. Reliance, thus, has to be placed on section 9 (2) clauses (a) and (b) of the Civil Servants Act, 1973, according to which in case of selection post, selection has to be made on the basis of merit and in the case of non-selection post on the basis of seniority-cum-fitness. Therefore, while examining the case of promotion from BS-21 to BS-22, no other criterion has to be taken into consideration except merit. There are no rules for promotion to selection post of grade-22 meaning thereby that competent authority may exercise discretion which has to be structured in view of the principles laid down in the judge made law by full application of mind.", "citation": "2010 SCMR 1301", "SCPCitation": "2010 SCP 4", "reported": null, "dateOfAnnouncement": "28-04-2010", "dateCreated": "28-04-2010", "fileSizeInBytes": 136}
