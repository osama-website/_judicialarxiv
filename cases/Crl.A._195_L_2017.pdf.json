JUSTICE QAZI MUHAMMAD AMIN AHMED", "judgmentText": null, "tagline": "Those acquitted from the charge are inexorably placed in an identical position with the present appellants. The witnesses were found unworthy of reliance; there is nothing to improve upon their credence; injuries suffered by them are not passports into the realm of truth; once rejected, evidence of prosecution's witnesses cannot be pressed into service to sustain the charge, similar on all fours. It would be unsafe to maintain the convictions without potential risk of error.", "citation": "2019   SCMR  1394", "SCPCitation": "2019 SCP 146", "reported": null, "dateOfAnnouncement": "", "dateCreated": "28-06-2019", "fileSizeInBytes": 21}
