Further, the court can examine and judicially review the executive discretion exercised by the Authorized Officer on the ground of proportionality. A disproportionate act that infringes upon a human right is an illegal act. Proportionality is a standard that examines the relationship between the objective the executive branch wishes to achieve, which has the potential of infringing upon a human right, and the means it has chosen in order to achieve that infringing objective.
