A tax credit, on the other hand, has no bearing on the assessment; it comes into operation after assessment and when the question of recovery arises. Clause (a) of subsection (1) of S. 159 of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 does not apply to a tax credit; therefore, no exemption certificate can be issued under S. 159 in respect of the same.", "citation": "2019   SCMR  1081", "SCPCitation": "2019 SCP 114", "reported": null, "dateOfAnnouncement": "15-05-2019", "dateCreated": "16-05-2019", "fileSizeInBytes": 59}
