Faqeer Muhammad", "caseFileName": "C.A._176_2015.pdf", "authorJudge": "MR. JUSTICE MIAN SAQIB NISAR", "judgmentText": null, "tagline": "Doctrine of merger was applicable to the reversal and modification cases and also to all those cases in which the judgment etc. of a lower forum had been affirmed in appeal or revision by a higher forum(s) subject to certain exceptions. Where the appellate/revisional/ constitutional forum recorded reasons on the consideration of the issues of law and/or fact, the judgment of subordinate court/forum would merge into the decision of the appellate court etc. irrespective of the fact that such judgment reversed, varied or affirmed the decision of the subordinate court/forum. Forum for application under S.12(2) of the C.P.C., in such circumstances, would be maintainable before the appellate/revisional/ constitutional forum (High Court, District Court, Tribunal or Special Court as the case may be). However, doctrine of merger has some exception, where appeal/revision/writ not disposed of on merits but on some other grounds. Same rule is applicable to Supreme Court as well. Where leave to appeal was declined by the Supreme Court, the judgment would not merge into the leave refusing order for the purposes of an application under S.12(2), C.P.C. which could only be filed before the last forum.  When a question of law and fact had been elaborately and explicitly dealt with by the Supreme Court in the leave refusing order, an application in the nature of S.12(2) of the C.P.C. could be filed before the Supreme Court.
