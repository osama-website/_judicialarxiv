Under section 10 of the Balochistan Civil Servants Act, 1974 a civil servant cannot insist to be posted or transferred to a particular post but this does not mean that a civil servant can be made to serve under a subordinate. Moreover, while section 10 does not prescribe a minimum period during which a civil servant must serve at his post it does not mean that the Government without assigning any reason can move a civil servant from the place he was posted to after a month or subject the civil servant to repeated postings in a short period of time because this would amount to punishing him.\r\n           \r\n", "citation": "2018   SCMR  1411", "SCPCitation": "2019 SCP 43", "reported": null, "dateOfAnnouncement": "22-05-2018", "dateCreated": "06-03-2019", "fileSizeInBytes": 63}
