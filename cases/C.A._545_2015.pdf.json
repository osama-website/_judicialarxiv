Ms. Imrana Tiwana & others", "caseFileName": "C.A._545_2015.pdf", "authorJudge": "Mr. Justice Mian Saqib Nisar", "judgmentText": null, "tagline": "Article 140A of the Constitution, in case of conflict in the exercise of their respective powers or on account of legal provisions having overriding effect, confers primacy upon the authority vesting in an elected Local Government over the powers conferred by law on the Provincial Government or an agency thereof. Section 46 of the Lahore Development Authority Act, 1975, purporting to override conflicting action taken by an elected Local Government, is held to be against the scheme of the Constitution and should either be read down or declared ultra vires as determined in the detailed judgment. Environment Impact Assessment cannot be struck down upon presumption or mere apprehension.  In the vacuum resulting from the absence of an elected Lahore Metropolitan Corporation, the initiation, approval and execution of the disputed Signal Free Corridor project by the Provincial Government through its agency, LDA, is held to be valid. The only touchstone for this purpose is conflict of statutory law with the provisions of the Constitution.\r\n\r\n\r\n", "citation": "2015   SCMR  1739", "SCPCitation": "2015 SCP 52", "reported": null, "dateOfAnnouncement": "08-07-2015", "dateCreated": "09-07-2015", "fileSizeInBytes": 23}
