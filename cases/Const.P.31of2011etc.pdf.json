ECP, under Article 219 of the Constitution, is also commanded to revise the electoral list annually. The electoral rolls of Karachi do not inspire confidence. An accurate Electoral Roll is a sine quo non for the holding of a free, fair and transparent election. Thus, ECP is directed to carry out proper and complete door-to-door verification in Karachi so as to ensure that no voter is disenfranchised or dislocated and all other discrepancies are rectified as early as possible.", "citation": "PLD 2013  SC 120", "SCPCitation": "2012 SCP 77", "reported": null, "dateOfAnnouncement": "05-12-2012", "dateCreated": "05-12-2012", "fileSizeInBytes": 988}
