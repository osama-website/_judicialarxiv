Once she has opted for a better group, the one she had previously been allocated in Open Merit will be left vacant. This vacant group seat is then transferred to the Women Quota which was short a seat when the candidate had opted for the then available better seat. This allows for there to be a constant number of reserved seats in the Women Quota without depriving deserving Female Candidates, higher on the merit list, better group seats.\r\n", "citation": "2019   SCMR  622", "SCPCitation": "2019 SCP 176", "reported": null, "dateOfAnnouncement": "17-12-2018", "dateCreated": "22-07-2019", "fileSizeInBytes": 543}
