JUSTICE QAZI FAEZ ISA", "judgmentText": null, "tagline": "The internal pricing mechanism of a manufacturer is not a substitute for proof/evidence of actual collection of sales tax in terms of section 3B of the Sales Tax Act, 1990. Section 3B does not refer to a notional recovery of sales tax. Therefore, since sales tax was not collected by the petitioner (cement manufacturer) the question of paying the same to the respondent (revenue department) simply did not arise.\r\n", "citation": "2017   SCMR  9", "SCPCitation": "2017 SCP 5", "reported": null, "dateOfAnnouncement": "14-10-2016", "dateCreated": "04-01-2017", "fileSizeInBytes": 56}
