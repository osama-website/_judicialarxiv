JUSTICE MIAN SAQIB NISAR, CJ", "judgmentText": null, "tagline": " None of the grounds settled by this Court for declaring a judgment per incuriam, including that the judgment was invalidly pronounced; based upon ignorance of any provisions of the Constitution or law; founded on gross and grave misinterpretation thereof; or that the law already enunciated and settled by this Court on a specific subject has not been taken into account, are to be found in the judgments challenged through the instant petitions. Where a person has/had the opportunity of filing a review or appeal against a judgment, and either files a review/appeal and fails, or does not avail that opportunity, or fails to become a party in any pending review/appeal filed by another person against the same judgment, then he has no right to re-agitate the matter through a petition under Article 184(3) of the Constitution. A judgment of this Court can be considered to be per incuriam but it is for the Judges to revisit any such judgment, if and when pointed out by any person during the course of hearing of any other case. \r\n", "citation": " \n2018   SCMR  514", "SCPCitation": "2018 SCP 7", "reported": null, "dateOfAnnouncement": "05-01-2018", "dateCreated": "24-01-2018", "fileSizeInBytes": 103}
