Aminullah (decd) through L.Rs. and others", "caseFileName": "C.P._289_P_2015.pdf", "authorJudge": "Mr. Justice Qazi Faez Isa", "judgmentText": null, "tagline": "The sale agreement is not a title document. The purported seller had specifically denied the execution of the sale agreement and no effort was made to establish his signature thereon. The two persons stated to be the witnesses of the sale agreement were not produced though one of them was admittedly alive. The purported scribe was not the person who had actually written the sale agreement. The sale agreement is dated before the enactment of the Qanun-e-Shahadat however the same is also not proved in terms of section 68 of the Evidence Act, 1872. Since the sale agreement was not proved therefore the benefit of section 53A of the Transfer of Property Act would also not accrue. The legal heirs of the purported buyer admitted that the purported seller was the owner of the said land therefore it was not a case of two contending claims where the purported seller had no title/ownership to the said land. Mere possession by the petitioners would not be the determinative factor in terms of Article 126 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat.
