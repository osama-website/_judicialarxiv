The judgment dated 31-07-2009, on dismissal of most of review petitions filed against it, has attained finality and the review petition filed by the appellant has not been entertained and rightly so by refusing to receive the same on valid objections. The settled principle of law is that what cannot be achieved directly cannot be permitted to be achieved indirectly.", "citation": "2010   SCMR  312", "SCPCitation": "2009 SCP 14", "reported": null, "dateOfAnnouncement": "11-11-2009", "dateCreated": "11-11-2009", "fileSizeInBytes": 41}
