JUSTICE MIAN SAQIB NISAR", "judgmentText": null, "tagline": "The Supreme Court has the discretion to grant leave at the time of hearing an appeal in which leave has been granted on a different point(s) and to consider such point of law, including for instance the question of inherent jurisdiction, undoubtedly being a pure question of law; even if not earlier taken up in any proceedings including those before the Supreme Court. This could very well apply to the point of limitation too where such plea was not dependent upon any factual determination. However, those cases which require a factual foundation and adjudication for the purposes of settling a legal issue cannot be said to be pure questions of law and the same cannot be allowed to be raised before this Court for the first time.", "citation": " \nPLD 2017 SC 158", "SCPCitation": "2017 SCP 24", "reported": null, "dateOfAnnouncement": "14-02-2017", "dateCreated": "14-02-2017", "fileSizeInBytes": 41}
