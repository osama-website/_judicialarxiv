Punjab", "caseFileName": "Crl.A._94_2019.pdf", "authorJudge": "Mr. Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah", "judgmentText": null, "tagline": "The Report of Government Analyst, in order to serve the purposes of the Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 1997 and the Control of Narcotic Substances (Government Analysts) Rules, 2001, must contain (i) the tests and analysis of the alleged drug (ii) the result of each test(s) carried out and (iii) the test protocols applied (the name(s) of protocols applied) to carry out these tests. Re-testing of the drug in case of a deficient report would amount to giving a premium to the prosecution for its mistakes and lapses. Any flaw in the case of the prosecution must only benefit the accused. The judgment reported as State v. Imam Bakhsh (2018 SCMR 2039) purposively interprets the Act and finds Rule 6 to be a mandatory provision. The report of the Government Analyst, whilst being admissible in evidence without formal proof, is rebuttable and can be questioned by the accused on the ground of non-compliance of the information required under Rule 6. The emphasis that the Report of the Government Analyst must carry the information required in Rule 6 is to ensure that convictions under the Act are based on reliable and credible reports.\r\n\r\n", "citation": "2019   SCMR  930", "SCPCitation": "2019 SCP 85", "reported": null, "dateOfAnnouncement": "08-04-2019", "dateCreated": "03-05-2019", "fileSizeInBytes": 197}
