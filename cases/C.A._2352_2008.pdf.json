On the other hand, when a subsequent execution application has been filed after the disposal of the first execution application, the objection of limitation may be relevant. However, even in such a case, the subsequent execution application may survive notwithstanding its belated institution beyond six years after the decree under execution, if it satisfies the test and criteria of amendment of a previously disposed of execution application that had been filed timely. \r\n", "citation": "2015   SCMR  1335", "SCPCitation": "2015 SCP 29", "reported": null, "dateOfAnnouncement": "13-04-2015", "dateCreated": "10-06-2015", "fileSizeInBytes": 33}
