Jahangir Khan Tareen, etc", "caseFileName": "C.A._307-L_2015.pdf", "authorJudge": "Mr. Justice Umar Ata Bandial", "judgmentText": null, "tagline": "The widespread scale of the violations of election law committed by the election staff makes the pervasiveness of their default to infect the election process as a whole with doubt and suspicion thereby materially affecting the election result and non-compliance of the election laws render whole election void. However, there is no circumstantial, let alone, any direct evidence implicating the appellant in the commission of corrupt or illegal practices during his election. Consequently, there cannot be any finding that the result of the said election is vitiated by such practices under Section 68(1)(d) or Section 70(b) of the Representation of People Act, 1976. A finding of fact about the disqualification of a returned candidate in election matters must be based on affirmative evidence and not on presumptions, inferences and surmises. The state of evidence on record about the falsity of the appellant's educational qualification is cursory, defused and inferential. Any reasonable hypothesis available in the recorded evidence to avoid the disqualification of the returned candidate under Article 62(1)(f) of the Constitution ought to be adopted by the Court of law.", "citation": "PLD 2016 SC 97", "SCPCitation": "2015 SCP 103", "reported": null, "dateOfAnnouncement": "28-10-2015", "dateCreated": "12-12-2015", "fileSizeInBytes": 103}
