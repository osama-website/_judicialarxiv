JUSTICE DOST MUHAMMAD KHAN", "judgmentText": null, "tagline": "The scheme of relevant provisions of Cr.P.C. and the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 show that the two categories of witnesses i.e. the prosecution witnesses and the defence witnesses are distinctly placed poles apart and cannot and shall not be intermingled. The discretion, to summon or examine any witness or refuse to do so, vested in the Trial Court ordinarily cannot be questioned and that too in extraordinary constitutional jurisdiction unless it is shown and established that exercise of such powers by the Trial Court or by not exercising the same, has resulted into a grave miscarriage of justice, therefore, calling the witness of the other party as its own witness, even in criminal trials, already examined, is not acknowledged by the law on the subject, therefore, it is neither desirable nor such a practice can be approved. In exceptional cases, where material witness has been dropped by the prosecution, the Court may exercise powers with due care and caution. However, in that case too, the prosecution witness/witnesses cannot be examined as defence witnesses but court witness/witnesses and for that, a written request is made to the Court showing cogent and convincing reasons for calling and examining any witness of the prosecution, not examined or has already been examined to be re-examined as court witness.
